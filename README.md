# Yolo-V-3-network-from-scratch-in-pytorch
yolo v3 in pytorch ( python version 3 ) for image real time image detection and video detection (video formate .avi supported by opencv ) 


This is complementary code for the video series that explains the implementation of yolo-v3 from scratch, available here. . My channel for cutting edge deep learning projects.

Yolo-V3
yolov3.cfg (236 MB COCO Yolo v3) - requires 4 GB GPU-RAM: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

Test:
Run the following command with optional commandline arguments to perform detections on images in 'images' folder. By default the 'result' folder will store the output.

python detect.py 
Run the following command with optional commandline arguments to perform detections on videos

python detect_video.py
